  <h2>HTML &amp; CSS for Print? Seriously?</h2>
  <p>Yes. Seriously.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>But, nobody does that, right?</h3>
  <p>It‚Äôs hard to tell who uses CSS for print.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>You can believe us</h3>
  <p>We‚Äôve been creating and using tools for <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/commit/3b96a7e">more than 10 years</a>. For professional use, we have generated tons of:</p>

    <li>invoices,</li>
    <li>reports,</li>
    <li>training booklets,</li>
    <li>slideshows,</li>
    <li>posters,</li>
    <li>letters‚Ä¶</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3>You can believe our users and our customers</h3>
  <p>They have surprising ideas!</p>
  <p>They generate university diplomas, electronic-ink labels, role-play books, leaflets for home appliance, menus for hotels (yummy!)‚Ä¶</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>You can believe big companies</h3>
  <p>You can be sure that at least <a href="https://medium.com/hederis-app/the-fundamental-thing-is-the-book-a-q-a-with-dave-cramer-f98ccd5360a5">Hachette sells millions of books</a> printed thanks to HTML and CSS.</p>
  <p>Millions. You may own one of these books.</p>

  <h3>CSS is not what you think</h3>
  <p>CSS is used for web pages, for sure.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>CSS is (also) designed for paged media</h3>
  <p>Since CSS2 in 1998 (20<sup>th</sup> century, were you born yet?), it includes <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/page.html">a "paged media" chapter</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>What you could do</h3>
  <div>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS2.1</a>, standard since 2011, you can:</div>
  <p/>
  <ul>
    <li>force page breaks,</li>
    <li>avoid page breaks,</li>
    <li>define how many widow and orphan lines are allowed,</li>
    <li>select first, left, right pages,</li>
    <li>add text and page numbers in margins.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>But Why Should I Change my Workflow and my Tools?</h2>
  <p>You don‚Äôt have to. But you can try.</p>
</section>
<section>
